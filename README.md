# GameJamExample
Our 3. Semester GameJam with the new 1. Semester pepos

Theme:  Escape the Simulation

This is meant as a sort of alternatively-structured example of avoiding code duplication, by creating an Event-class which can be used to handle all the textual scenarios that occur in the game (without repeatedly creating a method for each one, so Program.cs grows excessive).
